Richardson Maturity Model

Level 0: Expose SOAP WEB Services in REST Style

Level 1: Expose resources with proper uri

Level 2: Level 1 + proper use of http methods

Level 3: level 2 + HATEOAS


Best Practices:
Think of the people who will use my application (consumer first)
Have good documentation for apis (swagger)

Make the best use of HTTP, use get post put delete successfully, and send the correct response status

No secure info in URI

use plurals! (/users instead of /user)
